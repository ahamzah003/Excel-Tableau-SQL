## Fundraising
A fundraising dataset was analyzed for an hypothetical charity organization (Education for All) to help solve the challenge in meeting the fundraising target for the year.
The analysis was done with SQL, and key insights were visualized with Tableau. The underlying cause of the problem, using Root Cause Analysis, was found that the
fundraising caampaigns and solicitation efforts were not effectively reaching potential donor in some states. Check [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/abdulrahman.hamzat1331/viz/FundraisingDashboard_16930015457510/Dashboard1) to view the full dashboard.
